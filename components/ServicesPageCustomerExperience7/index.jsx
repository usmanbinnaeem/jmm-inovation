            Providing pleasant customer experience is the backbone in the
            success of organizations. Any organization, no matter how big or
            small, yearns to exceed customer expectations by adapting various
            methods such as value-for-money, customized and personalized
            products and services, and memorable customer experience. Due to
            this reason, organizations spend considerable time, effort and
            resources to continuously enhance customer journeys by delivering
            excellence that magnifies long term value for your customer and, as
            a result, to your organization and the society. <br />
            <br />
            At JMM Innovation, we believe that the process of ‘customer
            experience’ starts from the customer, and not the service provider.
            The moment customer thinks to avail your service or purchase your
            product, that is when it is important to gauge the touchpoints and
            the pain points in their entire journey to identify critical gaps,
            and grab opportunities of improvement for high-impact results. It is
            about documenting the emotions, priorities, liking and disliking,
            buying behaviors and patterns, and then focusing on how to improvise
            their experience after considering the financial, economic, social,
            and societal factors in a geography. The tricky part to this is that
            every region has its own technological, political, sociological, and
            cultural dynamics and in order to keep your customers happy, it is
            important to analyze, understand and carefully take those dynamics
            into consideration while building your processes and services.{" "}
