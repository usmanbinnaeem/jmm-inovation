            Pricing is one of the most important components that can multiply
            profits if set intelligently. While setting the optimum prices can
            yield higher revenues, over-pricing or underpricing can impact
            customer’s value for money or revenue targets, respectively. To
            combat this, companies nowadays are not pricing intuitively but
            adopting what is called smart pricing strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            include actual costs, current price, past pricing trends and
            patterns, competitor’s pricing data, customer’s perception of
            prices, cost structures, breakeven point, profitability, and pitting
